# Food_delivery_duration_modeling
### Description
The food delivery time prediction model plays a crucial role in the food delivery industry, where prompt and accurate delivery is of utmost importance. Delivery time directly impacts customer satisfaction and influences their overall experience.

To develop an effective prediction model, we began by thoroughly cleaning the dataset, ensuring it was free from errors and inconsistencies. This step was vital in ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the model's predictions.

Feature engineering was then employed to extract valuable insights from the dataset. By considering factors such as delivery person age, ratings, location coordinates, and time-related variables, we aimed to capture key variables that influence delivery time. These engineered features contributed to the model's predictive capabilities.

Using regression algorithms like linear regression, decision tree, KNN,we built the predictive model. Evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and R-squared (R2) score were used to assess the model's accuracy.
